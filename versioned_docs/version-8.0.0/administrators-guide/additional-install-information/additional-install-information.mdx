# Additional Installation Information

The easiest way to install Qube! is to use the installer. This will download the required components for you, and install them or uninstall them as necessary. However, you may still wish to perform this action manually, or to know more about what the installer is doing. This section deals with both of those issues, as well as the subject of upgrading your Qube! installation.
