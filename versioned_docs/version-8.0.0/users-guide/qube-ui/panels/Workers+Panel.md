# Workers Panel

## The Qube! UI Workers Panel

The Workers Panel behaves identically to the Jobs Panel but on
workers. Please refer to the [Jobs Panel](./Jobs+Panel) documentation
for detailed usage information.

Right-clicking on selected job(s) allows you to perform the following
actions.

    currently running jobs and returning them to pending.Â 

-   **Lock host (+ Finish Current)**: Finish currently running jobs and
    then lock the host.

-   **Partially lock**: Lock only a portion of the workers slots.

-   **Unlock host**: Unlock the host.

-   **Remove**: Remove the host from the Qube! farm, a clear banned must
    be run on the supervisor for this host to re-join the farm.

-   **Reboot host**: Reboot the host computer.

-   **Shut down host**: Shut down the host computer.

-   **Ping**: Ping the host computer.
