# Cinema4D macOS Submission

## Step by step instructions for submitting Cinema4D macOS jobs with Qube!

### Install the Qube! Submission UI into Cinema4D

**(First Time Only)**

If you want the submission menu inside of Cinema4D (recommended) then
install the InApp plugins via the QubeUI application as shown here. To
do this, launch the QubeUI:

-   **Windows**: Double-click the color desktop icon

-   **macOS**: Find the color icon in Applications/pfx/qubeui and
    double-click on it

Then navigate to the File menu, choose "Install App UI" and choose the
Cinema4D (macOS) option. This will install the Cinema4d (macOS)
submission UI only. You will need to do this on every workstation that
you intend to submit Cinema jobs from.

AppFinder vs macOS vs Windows

:::info

What's the difference?

**Qube! Submit (AppFinder)** uses information from the worker to
determine if it is running Windows or macOS, and then use the render
executable specific to that platform.

**Qube! Submit (macOS)** assumes the targeted workers are running macOS.

**Qube! Submit (Windows)** assumes the targeted workers are running
Windows.
