# Qube self-update functionality

We're often asked if all or part of Qube! can automatically update itself,
such as:

  * The Qube! supervisor automatically upgrading all or a portion of the workers in a farm
  * The clients have a "check for updates" function

Unfortunately, the short answer is "not yet". 

This is on our roadmap and should be available in a future version of Qube!
