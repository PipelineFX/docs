# Does PipelineFX offer Qube! hot or cold spares

:::note[Answer]
**PipelineFX does not offer cold or hot spare licenses of Qube! for the supervisor or workers.**
:::

This is a question that has been asked by a handful of clients, but it is not
common.

## The Supervisor

In the event of a hardware failure, the replacement hardware would need to
have it's MAC address mapped to the Supervisor, so the difference in keeping a
cold spare around and requesting a replacement license from PipelineFX would
be negligible. If the plan were to keep both the hardware and Qube! Supervisor
on a hot spare, then you would need to upgrade both your spare and production
Supervisor together so you don't get out of sync. In the mean time, you would
also need to make sure your database and assets are available to the hot spare
pair of hardware/software immediately. This is not common practice and is not
a frequent request from our clients, so in keeping with industry standard, we
do not offer this.

## The workers

Workers can be placed on any hardware, for the most part. There are very few,
if any, exceptions. So, spares just aren't needed and are not a concern. For
very short term license availability, we offer the option to rent worker
licenses per day, per month or per year. Plus, you can use Metered Licensing
to burst beyond your current capacity and only pay for what you use.
