# Beginner Python submission and dependencies

Welcome to a tutorial on basic submission and dependencies using the Qube!
API. By running through this tutorial you will have a basic understanding of
how to:

  1. Use Python to submit a basic job 
  2. Understand Job packages and what is required to submit jobs 
  3. Discover how to find the required fields for job packages in the Qube! GUI 
  4. Link jobs using dependencies 

This tutorial will be based loosely on a Renderman workflow which is a
commonly requested pipeline.

Requirements: A basic knowledge of Python is advisable. Most of the contents
of this tutorial can be copy and pasted to suit basic needs but further
development would be required for complex pipelines.
