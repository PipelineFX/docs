# Advanced Dependencies
The next step is to build a more robust dependency system. Building on what we have learnt in the previous tutorials this tutorial will: 
* Give example of JobLabel for linking jobs 
* Give example of Dependency linking to JobLabel
* Shows correct dependency graph in the QubeUI

Feel free to download and run the script below. It sets up a job that will :
* Create a Parent "Sleep job" with a range of 60 
* Create a Blocked Child "Sleep job" that links to the Parent job and waits for a complete status before starting

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
 
# Below are required imports for the script to run
import os
import sys
 
# The next few lines attempt to import the Qube! API. If the path to the qb module
# is not in $PATH or $PYTHONPATH, we will attempt to find it by looking in known
# locations
try:
    import qb
except ImportError:
    if os.environ.get("QBDIR"):
        qbdir_api = os.path.join(os.environ.get("QBDIR"),"api","python")
    for api_path in (qbdir_api,
                     "/Applications/pfx/qube/api/python/",
                     "/usr/local/pfx/qube/api/python/",
                     "C:\\Program Files\\pfx\\qube\\api\\python"):
        if api_path not in sys.path and os.path.exists(api_path):
            sys.path.insert(0,api_path)
            try:
                import qb
            except:
                continue
            break
    # this should throw an exception if we've exhuasted all other possibilities
    import qb
 
 
# Below is the main function to run in this script
def main():
     
    # ----------------Start creation of Parent Job----------------------------------------

    # Below defines an empty list for combining all tasks in the dependancy chain
    task = []
     
    # Below creates an empty dictionary to be filled by the following lines of code
    job = {}
     
    # Below defines a label for the dependancy to be used internally within this script
    job['label']= 'ParentLabel'
     
    # Below defines the name of the Qube! job
    job['name'] = 'python parent job'
     
    # Below defines how many Instances/subjobs the job is to spawn
    job['cpus'] = 1
     
    # Below defines the internal Qube! jobtype to be used to execute the job
    job['prototype'] = 'cmdrange'
     
    # The below parameters are explained further in the "Job submission with job package explained" page
    package = {}
    job['package'] = package
    job['package']['cmdline'] = 'sleep QB_FRAME_NUMBER'
     
    # Below defines the Agenda/Range of the job this will fill the Frames/Work section of the QubeUI
    # "0-60x10" is range 0-60 in chunks of 10 frames
    agendaRange = '0-60x10'
     
    # Below defines the internal command required to generate the agenda
    agenda = qb.genframes(agendaRange)
     
    # Below defines the job details for the agenda
    job['agenda'] = agenda
     
    # Below appends the details of this task to the job dictionary for later submission
    task.append(job)
     
    # ----------------Start creation of Child Job----------------------------------------
     
    # Below creates an empty dictionary to be filled by the following lines of code
    job = {}
     
    # Below defines a label for the dependancy to be used internally within this script
    job['label']= 'ChildLabel'
     
    # Below defines the dependancy of this job see below for possible dependancy strings
    job['dependency'] = 'link-complete-job-ParentLabel'
     
    # Below defines the name of the Qube! job
    job['name'] = 'python child job'
     
    # Below defines how many Instances/subjobs the job is to spawn
    job['cpus'] = 1
     
    # Below defines how many Instances/subjobs the job is to spawn
    job['prototype'] = 'cmdrange'
     
    # The below parameters are explained further in the "Job submission with job package explained" page
    package = {}
    job['package'] = package
    job['package']['cmdline'] = 'sleep 20'
     
    # Below appends the details of this task to the job dictionary for later submission
    task.append(job)
     
    # Below submits the task list to Qube!
    listOfSubmittedJobs = qb.submit(task)
     
    # Below prints out a list of jobs that have been submitted by name
    for job in listOfSubmittedJobs:
        print('%(name)15s: %(id)s' % job)
 
# Below runs the "main" function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
    sys.exit(0)
```

This script differs from the previous examples:

```py
# To create a list of jobs that are submitted:
task = []
```

```py
# Combines the list of jobs for final submission with:
task.append(job)
```

```py
# With this method the jobs are not submitted per "job = {}"
# instead combined and submitted once all tasks have completed:
listOfSubmittedJobs = qb.submit(task)
```

```py
# This creates a internal label for the job which is assessed at submission time:
job['label']= 'ParentLabel'
```

```py
# The Child job then uses the internal label to link to the Parent job.
job['dependency'] = 'link-complete-job-ParentLabel'
```
 

Here are some examples of how you can link the jobs: 

```py
# This will run once the Parent job is complete.
job['dependency'] = 'link-complete-job-ParentLabel'
```

```py
# This will run once the Parent job is failed.
# job['dependency'] = 'link-failed-job-ParentLabel'
```

```py
# This will run if the Parent job has been killed.
job['dependency'] = 'link-killed-job-ParentLabel'
```

```py
# This will run once the Parent job returns a status of done.
# Done means if the job completes,fails or has been killed.
job['dependency'] = 'link-done-job-ParentLabel'
```
 

You can also link jobs by different types.

```py
# This will run depending on the status of the jobs work.
job['dependency'] = 'link-done-work-ParentLabel'
```

```py
# This will run depending on the status of the jobs subjobs.
job['dependency'] = 'link-done-subjob-ParentLabel'
```
