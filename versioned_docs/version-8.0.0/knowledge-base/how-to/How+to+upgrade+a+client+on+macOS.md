# How to upgrade a client on macOS

There is no uninstall on macOS, so you simply install the newer qube packages
over top of the older ones. No data is lost during the uninstall/re-install.

## Installing the Qube Client and UI

The only condition is that the Qube-core is installed first.  You can install
all other Qube! components in any order.

The most common order is:

* install the Qube-core
* install the QubeUI
