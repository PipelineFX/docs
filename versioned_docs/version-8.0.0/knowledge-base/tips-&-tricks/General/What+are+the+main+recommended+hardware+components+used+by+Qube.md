# What are the main recommended hardware components used by Qube!?

From a hardware standpoint, the main things recommended are:

1. Server machine to act as the Supervisor
2. A File Server or NAS to store the scenes, textures, and rendered images in a central location.
3. Either artist workstations or a dedicated farm of Worker machines to process/render.
