# Event types

The _type_ of the event allows the system to identify the kind of event
referred to. The available pre-defined names are relative to the specification
of the type.  

The "types" of events are:

type | description
---|---  
job| Specifies the entire job  
subjob| Specifies a single subjob  
work| Specifies a single work agenda item  
host| Specifies the event belongs to a host  
time| Specifies a time-based event
<!-- time| Specifies a time-based event - see [here](/display/QUBE/How+to+submit+a+job+that+will+wait+until+later+to+run) -->
repeat| Specifies an interval event  
global| Specifies a time-based event that exists independent of a job
