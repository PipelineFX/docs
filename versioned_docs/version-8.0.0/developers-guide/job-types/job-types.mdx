# Job Types
  
The Job Type is one of the most powerful aspects of the Qube! Remote Control
system. With a Job Type, a developer can separate the application
functionality into an interface and an underlying implementation. The
interface is the "front end" that registers a job with Qube!. The
implementation is the "back end" that is actually run by Qube!. In order to
implement either the front end or the back end, some background in the Qube!
API is necessary. At its simplest, the front end needs to determine the
parameters of the job and the work agenda, and then register a job submission.
The back end must acquire the job parameters, and receive its agenda items
from the Supervisor frame server. The API provides function calls in a number
of languages to perform these tasks. Currently, the Qube! API supports C++,
Perl, Python, and MEL.
