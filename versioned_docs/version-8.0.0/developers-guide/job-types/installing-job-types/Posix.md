```
worker_template_path="/usr/local/pfx/qube/types:/site/qube/types"
```

In the above example, the administrator properly specified Qube's default
types as well as included a network-mounted directory, which contains the
studio's custom job types.  
Once this is done, job types may be installed in the site's Job Type
directory, allowing developers and users to build job types without direct
access to the installation directories.
