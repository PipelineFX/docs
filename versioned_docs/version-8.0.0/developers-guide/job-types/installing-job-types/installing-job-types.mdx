# Installing job types

Installing job types under Qube is simple. Just copy the entire Job Type
directory into the types directory under Qube's installation.

OS | Path
---|---
Windows | C:\Program Files\qube\types
Linux | /usr/local/pfx/qube/types
macOS | /Applications/pfx/qube/types

Because Qube is designed to be flexible, the administrator has the option to
relocate the type's path, or include additional paths for Qube to search in.
Our recommendation is for the administrator to locate the standard Qube job
types and the site specific job types in different directories.

To do this, the administrator must modify the qb.conf file. The tag to modify
is the [worker_template_path](administrators-guide/configuration-parameter-reference/worker_template_path).

Consult the [Qube Administrator's Guide, Centralized
Jobtypes](administrators-guide/configuring-qube/worker-configuration/Centralized+Jobtypes) for more information on setting
up Worker configuration.

## Examples

### Linux

```
worker_template_path="/usr/local/pfx/qube/[types:/site/qube/types](http://types/site/qube/types)"
```

In the above example, the administrator properly specified Qube's default
types as well as included a network-mounted directory, which contains the
studio's custom job types.  
Once this is done, job types may be installed in the site's Job Type
directory, allowing developers and users to build job types without direct
access to the installation directories.

### Windows

```
worker_template_path="C:/Program Files/qube/types;//server/share/site/qube/types"
```
