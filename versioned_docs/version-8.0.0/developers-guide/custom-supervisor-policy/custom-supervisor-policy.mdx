# Custom Supervisor Policy

Custom Supervisor Policy allows fine control over:

* whether to accept or reject each job submission
* whether to allow or disallow every job modification
* how the overall status of a job is determined, based on the subjob and agenda status of the job
* what actions a sudo admin may perform, and on which jobs

[Scripting policy](scripting-policy)
