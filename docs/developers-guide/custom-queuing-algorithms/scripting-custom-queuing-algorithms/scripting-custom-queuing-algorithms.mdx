# Scripting custom queuing algorithms

This is done using a script file plug-in written in Perl. The qb.conf setting
for this is as follows:  

```
supervisor_queue_binding = Perl  
supervisor_queue_library = _plugin_path_
```

This document isn't meant to be a tutorial on the Perl scripting language so
we will assume developers modifying this module in the following documentation
already have a functional knowledge of Perl's syntax. Good online resources
for learning Perl can be found at
[http://www.perl.com](http://www.perl.com) there also many good
published books such as _Learning Perl_ published by O'Reilly which can get a
beginning developer started with Perl scripting.  

To create a new queuing algorithm, the developer must create a Perl module
with the following Perl functions:

1. qb_hostcmp($hosta, $hostb, $job)
2. qb_init()
3. qb_jobcmp($joba, $jobb, $host)
4. qb_preemptcmp($runningjob, $candidatejob, $host)
5. qb_rejectjob($job, $host)
6. qb_starthost_deinit()
7. qb_starthost_init()
8. qb_startjob_deinit()
9. qb_startjob_init()

A function if not defined will automatically be overridden with the "Priority
Queuing Algorithm" defaults.  
Example scripts can be found the following locations:

OS | Path
---|---
Linux: | /usr/local/pfx/qube/examples/supervisor
Windows: | C:\Program Files\pfx\qube\examples\supervisor
macOS: | /Applications/pfx/qube/examples/supervisor

The functions defined are all used to control the queuing algorithm's
properties.
