# Custom Queuing Algorithms

Although Qube! is shipped with several pre-built and optimized queuing
algorithms, Qube! also allows developers to take advantage of the research
PipelineFX has done in queuing system design to write their own queuing system
algorithm. This is a feature has been implemented with the intent to allow
studios to design an algorithm which works well within their own pipeline.
