# Building Job Types
  
A Qube! Job Type is a simple framework for constructing all the code necessary for submission and execution of a job.  
A Job Type is a framework collection of files that are used to describe the properties of a job. In order to keep things in the same place, the Job Type is always located in a directory named after the Job Type.

For example, the Maya Job Type is located under the directory named maya.
Within the directory, the Job Type contains a file called: job.conf
