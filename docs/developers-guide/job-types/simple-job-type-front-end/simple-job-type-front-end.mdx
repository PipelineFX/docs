# Simple Job Type front end

Here is an Perl example of a typical job front end that can handle a job that
is based on frames.

## **Example**

```perl title="Perl" showLineNumbers
use lib ../api/perl; use qb;

my %env = %ENV;

my $frames = qb::genframes("1-300");

my $data = {  
"env" = \%env,

"cmdline" = /bin/sleep . int(rand(40) + 1) };

my $job = {  
"name" => "Frame Job", "priority" => 1, "prototype" => "frame", "branch" =>
"/",  
"cpus" => 20,  
"data" => $data,  
"work" => $frames  
};

my @jobs = qb::submit($job); for my $job (@jobs) {

print "submitted job - id: ", $job->{id}, "\n"; }
```
  
Initially set the path to the API library, and load the API module. Every job
contains a copy of the user's environment variables. These variables can be
manipulated, if necessary.
