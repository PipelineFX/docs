# Scripting Interfaces

Along with the commandline and GUI interfaces, Qube! can also be accessed via
scripting. Python and Perl languages are supported.
  
The SimpleCmd interface makes it easy to add new submission dialog interfaces
to Qube! through a dynamically loaded "plugin-style" framework in the Wrangler
View UI. Some of the simpler SimpleCmd interfaces can be done in just a few
minutes. Authoring complex scripts for a jobtype backend provides further
control for applications if needed.
  
The documentation can be found under the Help menu of the Wrangler View.
