# Triggers

A **trigger** is a series of [callback events]/trigger-event-syntax)
linked by logical operators into an expression. If the expression is evaluated
and the result is found to be true, the callback is said to have been triggered.

:::warning[&emsp;]
Developers writing callbacks should be aware that **callback triggers are
event-driven** (transitions from one state to another), not state-driven. So
if jobB is dependent on jobA, but jobA has completed before jobB is submitted,
the triggering event (the completion of jobA) will not occur again after jobB
is submitted; jobB's trigger condition will never be met.

This is why it's advisable to submit all jobs that are interdependent in one
pass as a process group; there is no chance of a trigger event occurring prior
to a job's submission.
:::

## Syntax

The syntax for specifying an event consists of:

```
name-type-context-extra
```

Refer to [Trigger Event Syntax](/trigger-event-syntax) for more
details.

## Operators

Triggers can be logically AND\'d or OR\'d, use the boolean operators **& &**
and **||**.  They can be grouped with parentheses \"( )\", but grouping **is
not supported**  when using the job **dependency**  attribute, only in
callbacks.

:::warning[&emsp;]
The **dependency** language (used when setting a job's **dependency**
attribute) uses a limited set of boolean operators, only AND and OR. The
convention for the dependency language is to provide a comma-separated list of
dependencies, such as: `link-complete-work-3927,link-complete-work-3928`,
these are \'&&\'d together.
:::

## Examples

When this job completes:

```
complete-job-self
```

When job 19294 starts running:

```
running-job-19294
```

When my \#2 subjob completes:

```
complete-subjob-self-2
```

When the job with the label 'hello' is done:

```
done-job-hello
```

The events are then combined together with simple operators to define more
complex scenarios:

When I complete and my parent completes:

```
complete-job-self && complete-job-parent
```

When the job labeled "sibling" starts running, and I am done:

```
running-job-sibling && done-job-self
```
