# Trigger Event Syntax

Breaking down the trigger event specification syntax, it's composed of 4
fields:

```
name-type-context-extra
```

Examples are:

* `complete-job-self` (when this job completes)
* `failed-work-self-\*`  (when any frame in this job fails)
* `complete-work-render-5` (when frame 5 in the job labelled "render" completes) - see [Referring to a job by label](#referring-to-other-jobs-in-a-callback-via-job-labels-vs-job-ids)

## Trigger syntax fields

1. [Event names](/Documentation/developers-guide/callbacks/triggers/trigger-event-syntax/Event+names)
2. [Event types](/Documentation/developers-guide/callbacks/triggers/trigger-event-syntax/Event+types)
3. [Event contexts](/Documentation/developers-guide/callbacks/triggers/trigger-event-syntax/Event+contexts)
4. [Extra fields (only certain context need this)](/Documentation/developers-guide/callbacks/triggers/trigger-event-syntax/Extra+fields) 
5. [Process group labels](/Documentation/developers-guide/callbacks/triggers/trigger-event-syntax/Process+group+labels)

## Referring to other jobs in a callback via job labels vs job id's

Qube introduces the concept of job **labeling**. A job label is a separate
field in a Qube job which is used to help other jobs **refer to that job by
name rather than its job ID**.

When designing a job dependency graph, developers were previously forced to
submit the jobs in order of precedence, collecting job ids and using them to
initialize the child jobs. This technique is messy and a takes a significant
amount of development to implement. It also limits the dependencies to a
directed graph, and will not lend itself to a feedback loop job easily.

Another alternative is to use the job's name to identify the job's dependency
relationship. This method doesn't work well because a user is then committed
to a strict naming convention when submitting to the farm.

To solve this, Qube uses its **process group**  job attribute in combination
with the job's label. The only prerequisite is that the jobs be submitted with
the same process group ID.  All jobs submitted with the same `qb.submit()`
call are automatically joined into a new pgrp; each has the same process group
ID, which is the job ID of the first job submitted (also known as the **_pgrp
leader_**).

:::warning[&emsp;]
Job Labels **must be unique within the process group**.

The Qube Supervisor automatically enforces the uniqueness requirement and will
not allow duplicate job labels to be submitted, instead the submission will be
rejected.
:::

During submission, a developer _may_ link jobs to the same process group by
collecting the lead job's process group ID and then using that to submit the
successive jobs, setting each job's `pgrp` value.  A simpler method is to
submit all the jobs under the same API submit call, which automatically
attaches all jobs to the same process group.

This process group/label system solves 2 problems:

1. The developer isn't forced to collect the job ids.
2. The developer isn't required to use a naming convention for their jobs.

The system also offers several major benefits:

1. Resubmission, cloning and storage of a process group are simpler.
2. Feedback loop job relationships are made possible.

## Event Names

The _name_ is the component of the event which details when the event should
take place. This is either pre-defined, or user-defined.

The possible pre-defined event names for jobs are:

Event Name| Event Trigger  
---|---  
complete| Job is set to complete  
done| Job is set to complete or killed or failed  
submit| Job has been submitted  
killed| Job has been killed  
blocked| Job has been blocked  
failed| Job has failed  
running| Job has started running  
waiting| Job has been set to waiting  
assigned| Job has been assigned to a host  
removed| Job has been removed  
modified| Job has been modified  
dummy| Event is time-based
<!-- dummy| Event is time-based - see [here](/display/QUBE/How+to+submit+a+job+that+will+wait+until+later+to+run) -->
  
## Event Types

The _type_ of the event allows the system to identify the kind of event
referred to. The available pre-defined names are relative to the specification
of the type.  

The "types" of events are:

type | description
---|---  
job| Specifies the entire job  
subjob| Specifies a single subjob  
work| Specifies a single work agenda item  
host| Specifies the event belongs to a host  
time| Specifies a time-based event
{/* time| Specifies a time-based event - see [here](/display/QUBE/How+to+submit+a+job+that+will+wait+until+later+to+run) */}
repeat| Specifies an interval event  
global| Specifies a time-based event that exists independent of a job  
  
## Event Contexts

The _context_ or the "label" of the event is a specification to narrow the
scope of the event. When someone specifies 'job' they don't normally mean all
jobs, so a context is required to determine which job they are describing. A
context can be specified in 3 different forms:

1. pre-defined label
2. process group label  (see: [Job Labels](developers-guide/Job+Labels))
3. job ID

 The Pre-defined labels are:

label| description  
---|---  
self| This job  
parent| The job referred to by  _pid_  
  
## Context-specific extra fields

The _extra_ in the event specification refers to the type of event. Each type
of event may require additional information.

In the case of the job, it requires nothing more. However in the case of the
subjob it requires the subjob's ID number.  

## Example

When the job's instance \#5 is done, execute callback: `done-subjob-self-5`

Extra information required by each _type_:

type | information required
---|---  
job| None  
subjob|  _subjobid_  
work|  _workid/name_  
host|  _hostname_  
time|  _timeofday_  
repeat|  _timeofday_ -_interval_  
global| None  
globaltime|  _timeofday_  
globalrepeat|  _timeofday_ -_interval_  
  
:::warning[&emsp;]
The time of day is given in Qube time format. Intervals are in seconds.
