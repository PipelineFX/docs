# Centralized Worker Configuration

You can create a central configuration for all Workers in two ways: via the
QubeUI from the supervisor host, or by manually editing the qbwrk.conf file on
the supervisor host. This page discusses both methods.

## Configuration file name and location
The central worker configuration file is optional and may not yet exist on your
supervisor.  The default name and location is:

| OS             | Path                               |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Linux & macOS: | /etc/qbwrk.conf                    |
| Windows:       | C:\ProgramData\pfx\qube\qbwrk.conf |

An alternate name and/or location can be specified with the
[supervisor_worker_configfile](/Documentation/administrators-guide/configuration-parameter-reference/supervisor_worker_configfile)
parameter in the supervisor's qb.conf file.  

## Configuring via the QubeUI
The central Worker configuration can be managed through the QubeUI from the
Supervisor. Using the Workers tab, select one or more machines, \<right-click\>
to get the menu, and choose "Configure on Supervisor"

:::warning
This menu item is only enabled when:
* running the QubeUI on the supervisor host
* the user has the Qube! 'admin' privilege
:::

The worker configuration UI will be shown.  Make any desired changes. Any
values that you edit will have their labels turn green, as in the
worker_description field to the right.

Clicking OK will save the changes to the central worker configuration, at which
time the Supervisor will automatically instruct all workers to re-request their
configuration from the Supervisor.  No Supervisor or Worker restart is
necessary.  Any Workers not currently running will receive the changes when
they next start up.

## Configuring Manually
An administrator can also edit the qbwrk.conf file manually. Here are the steps:

**Create** the qbwrk.conf file if it doesn't already exist, on the Supervisor
machine in the correct location:

**Edit** the qbwrk.conf file with a text editor using the file format described
on this page.

**Validate** the qbwrk.conf file using the qbconfigure command. More details on
this page.
```
$ qbconfigfile <qbwrk file location>
```

**Push** the settings to the Workers using the qbadmin command
```
$ qbadmin worker --reconfigure
```

:::warning
It may take a few minutes to perform this action if the farm is large.
