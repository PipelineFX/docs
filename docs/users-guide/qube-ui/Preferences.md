# Preferences

## Centralized Preferences

The Qube! UI stores most preferences in a centralized database on the
supervisor. This can be used by Qube! administrators to set defaults or
enforce preference values at the studio level. Right-clicking on any
value in the preferences dialog will bring up the option to save
\'Studio Defaults\' and either make the default overridable or mandated.
Each user\'s preferences value will set to this default unless they have
already chosen a value for this preference and the default is
overridable.

## Mandate a preference value

**Right-click on any preference\'s value, then select Save
default-\>Studio Defaults-\>Mandated.**\

## Remove a mandated preference value

**To remove a mandated default simply right-click on the value and click
\"Clear mandated default\".**\

## Using system environment variables to override preferences

While using the centralized preferences system is the best way to
configure user preference values, you can also override preference
values by setting environment variables. Each supported preference has
an associated preference key that you can set an environment variable
for, see the preferences details table below. All preferences can be set
but some have complex formatting and it\'s recommended not to set them
as incorrect values can lead to errors within the Qube! UI, if you still
want to set them please send an email to Â for details - alternatively
you can look in the preferences database on the supervisor for
formatting examples.
