# User's Guide 

This User's Guide is aimed at artists who will be submitting and monitoring
their own jobs. The guide contains:

[Qube! Basics](/Documentation/users-guide/Qube+Basics)\
Explains the concepts behind Qube!'s operation, and what happens when a job
is submitted.

[QubeLocker](/Documentation/users-guide/Qube+Locker)\
Small utility to lock/unlock your local machine when it is configured as a worker

[Qube! UI](./qube-ui)\
Details of our Graphical User Interface

For larger installations, where people monitor and manage jobs for users other
than themselves, the Qube UI is typically used.

The Administrator's Guide discusses installing and tuning Qube! for specific
deployments.

TDs and other technical users can create their own jobtypes and also script
customizations of Qube!. These actions are explained in the Developer's Guide.
